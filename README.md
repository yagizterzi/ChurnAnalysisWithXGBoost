# Churn Analysis with XGBoost


This project applies XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, to analyze and predict customer churn. The goal is to identify factors influencing customer retention and optimize predictive performance.

## Features
- Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover churn patterns and insights
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation using XGBoost
- Detailed performance metrics and visualization

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yagizterzi/ChurnAnalysisWithXGBoost.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ChurnAnalysisWithXGBoost
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the main script to perform EDA, train the model, and evaluate its performance:
```bash
python churn_analysis.py
```

## Dependencies
Ensure the following libraries are installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- xgboost
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Workflow
The project workflow consists of:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial data analysis to understand churn patterns, identify trends, and inform feature selection.
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:** Cleaning and transforming data to improve model performance.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Building the churn prediction model using XGBoost and assessing its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization:** Generating plots to visualize data insights and feature importance.
